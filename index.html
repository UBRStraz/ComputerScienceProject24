   <h1>About Me</h1>

   <h3>|Basic Information|</h3>
   
  <!-- This is the paragraph -->
    <p>My name is <strong>DeVonte Johnson</strong>. I am 17 years old and am born in Colorado;
      I still live there.</p>

  <h3>|Intrests|</h3>
  <p>My main intrests are weightlifting, videogames, cars, and kaijus. I train Tuesday through Saturday each week. 
    My training scedule, going by each day beginning to end, is pull, push, legs, powerlifting, weakness assesment.
    Basically pulling excercises, pushing exercises, leg exercises, benching squatting and deadlifting, and finally 
    any exercise that strengthens my weak spots. My favorite cars are mostly American. Brands like Dodge, Ford, Chevy,
    Cadillac, and SSC. I tend to prefer fighting and FPS games, but, sometimes I find a good story-based game I'm fond of.
    When it comes to kaijus I mainly like the ones from the Godzilla series. My favorites are Godzilla, Ghidora, Destroyoah, and Mothra.
